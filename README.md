# thesisTemplate

An example of how to organize an ISU PhD thesis

- Get most recent [isuthesis Document Class](https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/thesis/thesis_template/)

Directory structure on your computer should have paper1/, paper2/ and 
paper3/ (or more) as sub-folders within this thesis directory folder and 
these chapters should be added to `.gitignore`. 
Ideally you would use more informative filenames than these.
The structure of the chapter files should copy the 
[paper1/](https://github.com/jarad/paper1).

You will need to update the following files in this template:

- titlepage.tex
- abstract.tex
- introduction.tex
- thesis.tex
- acknowledgements.tex
- dedication.tex
- mybib.bib
